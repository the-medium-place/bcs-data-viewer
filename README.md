## Description
This application is to be used by the instructional staff for a 2U/Trilogy coding bootcamp.  It uses the BootcampSpot API to gather data about cohorts associated with the logged-in user. This application will simplify many of the time-consumptive tasks such as forming project groups, viewing grade patterns throughout the cohort, and taking notes/grading of group projects and presentations.
